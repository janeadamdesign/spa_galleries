    0: "Philip Bret-Day at The Spa Galleries is a small general dealer specialising in the buying and selling of inexpensive, easily collectable prints and pictures. He currently represents a number of local contemporary painters.",
    1: "A keen researcher, Philipâ€™s particular area of expertise is Georgian optical views and Deco fashion, but he has a wide knowledge of many pre-1930s works on paper. Additional knowledge of Russian and French art history (as well military history in general) gives Philip a well-rounded yet paradoxically niche view on the art world.",
    2: "Philip is also a regular contributor to arts appreciation events, delivering talks on Coco Chanel, Casanova in London and the History of the camera obscura in the development of painting.",
    3: "When space allows the gallery can sometimes accommodate small exhibitions.",
